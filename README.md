<h2 align=center>About me</h2>
I'm a passionate 21-year-old student from Poland with a particular interest in the fields of CyberSecurity, Programming, and Linux. As an active member of the <a href="https://whitehats.pwr.edu.pl/">WhiteHats PWr</a> academic circle, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills within these areas. My love for technology began at a young age, as I started coding when I was nine years old. <br><br>

In addition to attending various conferences, I have experience working with several programming languages such as Rust, Lua, and Python, as well as tools like Docker and many more. While I can handle website development tasks, it is not my primary focus. I know English pretty well. <br>

Apart from my technical pursuits, I also enjoy engaging in other hobbies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), Speedcubing, Chess, and Gaming. <br><br>
Currently learning `Web Security`. <br>
